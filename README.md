## <a name="about"> Project Overview </a>

"Uncovering CUNY TV's Audiovisual Heritage" aims to digitize, preserve, caption, and make accessible nearly 1300 videotape recordings from CUNY TV's 35 year history. 

Funding for project was awarded by the _Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Enabling New Scholarship through Increasing Access to Unique Materials_, a national grant competition administered by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). The initial proposal can be accessed as an [appendix](#app). 

## <a name="coll">Collections Uncovered</a>

The City University of New York (CUNY) is the largest university network in the country with over two dozen schools in every one of New York City's five boroughs. The chart below lists the five the schools partnering with this project, and CUNY TV collections they manage. Each collection is comprised of a series that aired on public television between the 1980s and early 2000, but only available on an obsolete videotape(or audiotape) format. Collectively, the content tells the story of New York City as it grapples with public policy and social justice in a delicate era just before, and just after, 9/11. Clicking through each institution will reveal a one-page description of the collections in their care.

### Timeline

The Gantt chart below visualizes the 18 month timeline (9/1/2020 - 2/28/2022). Collections will be completed self-contained cycles comprised of such tasks as cataloging, digitization, ingest, captioning, and public access. The length of time estimated is informed by the number of tapes in the collection. Outreach efforts will officially begin February 2021 after the first cycle is complete and will be engaged on a weekly basis via social media, press releases, newsletters, listervs, blog posts, and person-to-person contact. The timeline also indicates semesters where a student intern will assist the efforts.

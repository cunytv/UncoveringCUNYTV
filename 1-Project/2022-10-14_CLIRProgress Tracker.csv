This two-part series evaluates the legacy of The Voting Rights Act (VRA) and advocates for its reauthorization by Congress. 

After welcoming remarks by Stan Altman (Dean, School of Public Affairs), Marianne Engleman-Lado (General Counsel, NY Lawyers for Public Interest), granddaughter of Lillie and Nathan Ackerman, introduces the lecture series and its visiting professor, Sonia Jarvis. The symposium's keynote, Wade Henderson (Executive Director, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights) reviews the historical events that led to the passing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and illustrates how the VRA applies to more recent case studies in voter suppression. Henderson introduces two special provisions of the VRA that apply to certain jurisdictions based on demographics: Section 5, which requires preclearance before changes can be made to election practices, and Section 203, requiring language assistance at polling locations. Nina Perales (General Counsel, MALDEF San Anthonio) follows up with her experiences advocating for the voting rights for Mexican-Americans. Perales also covers the special provisions of the VRA, particularly section 203, and how it increased voter turnout among Mexican-Americans.  Recorded on April 19th, 2005 at Baruch College.

This two-part series evaluates the legacy of The Voting Rights Act (VRA) and advocates for its reauthorization by Congress. 

Part two begins with Douglas Kellner (Commissioner, New York City Board of Elections). Kellner gives perspective on the Voting Rights Act and the Help America Vote Act as they pertain to NYC elections. Kellner is followed by Debo P. Adegbile (Assistant Counsel, NAACP Legal Defense Fund). Adegbile tells more about what is sufficient and what is insufficient of Section 5 (pre-clearance) and Section 203 (language assistance) in the VRA, and reminds the audience that voter disenfranchisement still exists. Veronica S. Jung (Exec. Director, Asian Pacific American Voters Alliance) represents both the Asian-American community and grassroots organizing. Jung tells a story that illustrates the failures of Section 203 in providing language assistance to a Korean family and more broadly speaks on the provision's impact in NYC communities. 

Professor Sonia Jarvis provides introductory remarks and moderates the Q&A, which includes a question from audience member Andy Humm, host of Gay USA. Recorded on April 19th, 2005 at Baruch College.

Professor Sonia Jarvis (Lillie & Nathan Ackerman Visiting Distinguished Associate Professor) introduces the speakers and moderates the discussion. Recorded on November 9th, 2006 at Baruch College.

All tapes are recorded in black and white. Residual color may be detected in the artifacts and this is from the color burst that the TBC added during capture.

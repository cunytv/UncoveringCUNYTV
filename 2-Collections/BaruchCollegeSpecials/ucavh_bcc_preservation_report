<h1>1 Project Summary	</h1>
<p>
This paper serves as succinct documentation for the Uncovering CUNY’s
Audiovisual Heritage Project (UCAVH), for which Bronx Community College,
Archives & Special Collections (BCC) is a participant. The paper aims to clarify
issues and specifications that are unique to the preservation efforts for the
Hall of Fame for Great Americans Collections (Call # LD3885.H3 A5), in which
15.5 hours of recorded content was migrated from an obsolete carrier to an
accessible digital format.
</p>
<h2>1.1 Uncovering CUNY’s Audiovisual Heritage</h2>
<p>
UCAVH  is a multi-year project that aims to digitize, describe, and make
accessible the videotape collections held in archives across the CUNY network.
The project is spearheaded by CUNY-TV and makes use of its in-house digitization
equipment and OAIS-based digital repository. The project is funded by the
Council for Library and Information Resources’ <em>Digitizing Hidden Special
Collections and Archives: Enabling New Scholarship through Increasing Access to
Unique Materials</em>.  Readers are encouraged to browse the project's dashboard
for more extensive details and documentation about the UCAVH project: <a
href="https://github.com/cunytv/UncoveringCUNYTV/blob/main/README.md">https://github.com/cunytv/UncoveringCUNYTV/blob/main/README.md</a>.
</p>
<h2>1.2 Bronx Community College, Archives & Special Collection</h2>
<p>
Thirty-five audiovisual objects from the Hall of Fame for Great Americans
collection were selected for the UCAVH project (of these, only 26 were
digitized).
</p>
<p>
The recordings are related to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, an outdoor
sculpture gallery in Gould Memorial Library. Most of the recordings are on ¼”
open reel audio, with 5 recordings on ¾” U-Matic tape. The content documents the
ceremonies inducting individuals into the Hall of Fame.
</p>
<p>
These materials were not initially part of the grant application but folded into
the project in May 2021. The tapes were received by Kelly Haydon in Feburary of
2022 and returned to Cynthia Tobar in June 2022.
</p>
<h2>1.3 Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
CUNY-TV agrees to digitize the collection mentioned above and return the
following before the project’s end:
</p>
<ul>
<li>35 audiovisual objects submitted for preservation
<li>26 Archival Information Packages (AIP)
<li>1 Spreadsheet of descriptive and preservation metadata
<li>1 Preservation Report
<li>21 Automated transcription files (for audio)
<li>5 Automated caption files (for video)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
CUNY-TV will store the AIPs - the preservation master file, digital derivatives,
pertinent technical metadata, and file fixities - in the long-term digital
repository on LTO tape. Bronx Community College is welcome to retrieve files by
contacting CUNY-TV <a href="mailto:archive@tv.cuny.edu">archive@tv.cuny.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
The minimum responsibility of Bronx Community College to the Uncovering CUNY’s
Audiovisual Heritage Project is to publicly post the descriptive metadata prior
to the Fall of 2022, the end of the grant cycle. Public domain metadata is a
requirement of CLIR. The metadata could be presented in a finding aid or the
description of the videos, so long as it is discoverable. Otherwise,
administrative, storage, access, description, and outreach can be folded into
current BCC workflows and practices for digital video content.

</p>
<h1>2 Physical Objects </h1>
<h2>2.1 Formats</h2>
<p>
The collection consists of ¼” open reel audio, ¾” U-Matic videotape, VHS, floppy
disks, a Zip drive, and a 16mm film. Of these only the audio and videotapes were
transferred. A complete inventory is available in section 6. The inventory
includes more detailed notes on the condition and transfer status of each tape.
The next few sections provide a summarization.
</p>
<h2>2.2 Condition/Conservation</h2>
<h3>2.2.a  Videotapes </h3>
<p>
Nearly all of the U-Matic tapes are in various stages of Soft Binder Syndrome
and were “baked” prior to transfer. Baking tapes is a short-term remedy for
restoring the tape to a point where it can be played and digitized. Baking
videotapes at CUNY-TV involves incubating tapes in a LEM brand food dehydrator
at 125°F for 30 hours. The tape reels are removed from the cassette for more
thorough baking, resulting in the label of the tape’s spine being cut with a
straight razor.
</p>
<p>
The following tapes are so far degraded they needed multiple baking sessions
before. They also exhibit inherent color issues and dropout.
</p>
<p>
    BCC00015	G.W. Carver: Enshrinement to Hall of Fame (Tape 1 of 3)
</p>
<p>
    BCC00016	G.W. Carver: Enshrinement to Hall of Fame (Tape 2 of 3)
</p>
<p>
    BCC00017	G.W. Carver: Enshrinement to Hall of Fame (Tape 3 of 3)
</p>
<p>
The two VHS tapes in the collection are both off-air recordings (taped off of
the television) and did not display any conservation issues.
</p>
<h3>2.2.b  Audiotapes</h3>
<p>
The ¼” open reel audio tapes displayed minimal Soft Binder Syndrome and were not
baked. The tapes were warped and crinkled, especially in the first few feet.
Many of the tapes had splices, denoting that the audio was edited. Our
technician careful respliced the old splices with new splices and wound the
tapes in a tighter wind to avoid further crinkling.
</p>
<p>
All audiotapes were recorded with a low integrated loudness, around - 40 LUFs.
This level was retained in the preservation master file. To achieve the
integrated loudness level recommended by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBU_R_128">EBU-R 128</a>, we created a
second “restoration” file with the integrated loudness adjusted to -23 LUFs.
</p>
<p>
Item BCC00003 (‘Jane Addams Installations into the Hall of Fame for Great
Americans, Tape 3 of 4’) required significant conservation treatment and
post-digital restoration. The tape was spliced together by pieces of Band-aid
with some sections spliced backwards. The master copy preserves the backwards
recordings. The “restoration” copy restores the original playback and speed. The
restored copy was also trimmed of long silences in the audio.
</p>
<h2>2.3 Transfer Status</h2>
<p>
Of the 35 objects submitted to the project, 26 were successfully transferred. Of
these, the two VHS tapes are off-air recordings of televised works; BCC may not
have rights to make them publicly available.
</p>
<p>
Objects that were not digitized will have an empty Transfer Date field on the
inventory (Section 6). Notes on why they were not transferred are in the
Transfer Notes field. Objects that were NOT TRANSFERRED are for the following
reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>They are already transferred and made available by another entity
<li>They are duplicates of another object that was transferred
<li>They are on a format that is not covered by the parameters of this project
(computer disks)
</li>
</ul>
<h1>3 Digital Deliverables</h1>
<p>
This section details the digital deliverables provided to BCC in June of 2022 on
an external hard drive.
</p>
<h2>3.1 Archival Information Package (AIP)</h2>
<p>
The Archival Information Package, or AIP, is an attribute of the OAIS framework,
an ISO reference model for digital preservation repositories. The AIP in
physical form is a directory of files organized into metadata and object files.
The AIP is slightly different for Audio files and video files. The contents of
each AIP include:
</p>
<h3>3.1.a Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li>objects/…All physical formats within the asset are wrapped in the Broadcast
WAV format and encoded in PCM with either a 24 or 32 bit dept and a 96khz sample
rate. Restoration files (_restored.wav) were boosted to meet EBU R 128
recommendations for integrated loudness (-23 LUF).
<li>objecs/access/mp3…contains a smaller, more shareable .mp3 file for each of
the master files (both the original and the restored)
<li>metadata/…
<ul>
<li>checksum, list checksums of all digital objects
<li>checksumchecks, date/time stamps of when checksums were created
<li>dfxml, digital forensics xml schema of technical metadata
<li>mets,  xml output of technical metadata in METS schema
</li>
</ul>
<li>metadata/depictions…a .png snapshot of the audio waveform and a visual graph
representing the RMS and phase of the waveform.
<li>metadata/fileMeta…XML outputs of technical metadata from four different
readers.
<li>metadata/logs…
<ul>
<li>capture.log, metadata on the creation of the AIP package, this may also
include notes by the technician
<li>capture_options, output of transfer environment, vrecord options, and notes
on dropped frames and presentation timestamp discontinuity (errors).
<li>vrecord_input, metadata on the digital detail as it entered the vrecord
software.
<li>framemd5, frame-level md5 checksums
<li>qctools, XML file for viewing in the qctools software
<li>qctools graph, a snapshot of qctools video/audio data as a .jpeg.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
3.1.b Video
</p>
<ul>
<li>objects/…All physical formats within the asset are encoded to a 10-bit FFV1
and wrapped in Matroska (.mkv).
<ul>
<li>Note: FFV1/.mkv files are readable by most open-source media programs such
as VLC Player. It is generally not supported by proprietary software. However,
it is not recommended that the master be accessed other than transcoding to new
files for editing, streaming, and viewing. The filename of the master(s) are
format id, or instantiation id, which are combined when creating derivatives
</li>
</ul>
<li>objects/access…
<ul>
<li>images, a collection of ten randomly selected frames as .tiff files
<li>mp3, the audio track of the video files
<li>prores, a highly quality prores/.mov file recommended for editing,
color-grading, and releasing to media makers
<li>youtube_up, an h264/.mp4 file used for viewing, streaming, and sharing.
</li>
</ul>
<li>metadata/…same as Audio
<li>metadata/depictions…a .png snapshot of the audio waveform
<li>metadata/fileMeta…same as Audio
<li>metadata/logs…same as Audio
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.2 Metadata and Documentation </h2>
<p>
The following items are included as deliverables on the external hard drive and
as documents downloadable from Github: <a
href="https://github.com/CUNYTV/UncoveringCUNYTV">https://github.com/CUNYTV/UncoveringCUNYTV</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>ucavh_bcc_transferlog/…
<ul>
<li>A complete log of metadata generated through the preservation process,
including descriptive metadata and notes on transfer, conservation treatment,
and quality control.
</li>
</ul>
<li>ucavh_clir_grantapplication/…

<li>ucavh_bcc_documention/…
<ul>
<li>A digital copy of this report.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.3 Caption Files</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access files from each asset were auto-captioned by Maestro, a proprietary
transcription tool.
<ul>
<li>Caption files for video were delivered to BCC as SubRip files (.srt), widely
accepted by streaming and playback platforms. Audio files received timed
transcripts in the .txt format.
<ul>
<li>To playback the files locally with the captions overlaid, both the access
and video files must be in the same directory with the same filename. YouTube
and Internet Archive have modules for uploading captions and transcripts.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Files may be manually corrected using open-source readers such as AegisSub
or YouTube’s caption studio.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>5 Access </h1>
<h2>5.1 Recommendations</h2>
<p>
In addition to providing access to researchers in the reading room or on the
library’s homegrown streaming service, BCC may want to consider uploading to
Internet Archive or Youtube to receive a wider audience. CUNY TV hosts a very
active Internet Archive channel and can assist with the process: <a
href="https://archive.org/details/@cuny_tv">https://archive.org/details/@cuny_tv</a>.
</p>
<p>
All files should be streamed with their caption file to reach a diversity of
users, preferably corrected by hand and following CUNY TV guidelines for
captioning: <a
href="https://www.cuny.edu/accessibility/content/videos/">https://www.cuny.edu/accessibility/content/videos/</a>
</p>
<p>
Takedown notices, accessibility statements, and disclaimers are all recommended,
so viewers with concerns have pathways for making contact. CentroPR, another
UCAVH participant, has these on their on Internet Archive page: ​​<a
href="https://archive.org/details/@centropr">https://archive.org/details/@centropr</a>
</p>
<h2>5.3 Accreditation </h2>
